# Natural Degongestant
Adults take 1-2 tablespoons daily as needed. Shake well before using, as the powder doesn’t dissolve in the most pristine way. I find it pleasant sometimes to warm the mixture before taking it.

## Ingredients
* ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon of ginger, finely grated
* 3 tablespoons of all natural organic honey
* 1/4 cup of lemon juice
* lemon zest, finely grated
* 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar

## Directions
# Pour ¼ cup of lemon juice and ¼ cup of apple cider vinegar in pot and bring to a gentle simmer.
# Stir in 2-3 tablespoons of raw organic honey
# Add ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper and ginger each (the latter amount makes it quite strong.)
# Store in a jar in a cool, dark, place indefinitely.
