# Strawberry Pretzel Jello

Derived from https://spicysouthernkitchen.com/strawberry-pretzel-salad

## Ingredients
- 2 cups crushed thin salted pretzels
- 3/4 cup butter, melted
- 3 tablespoons sugar
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 8-ounces of wipped cream (see wipped cream recipe)
- 1 (6-ounce) package strawberry Jello-O
- 2 cups boiling water
- 2 cups thinly sliced fresh strawberries

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
1. In a medium bowl, mix together crushed pretzels, butter, and 3 tablespoons sugar. Press into a lightly greased 9X13-inch pan. Bake for 8 minutes and cool completely.
1. Use an electric mixer to beat cream cheese and 1 cup sugar until smooth. Fold in whipped topping using a rubber spatula. Spread over cooled pretzel crust being sure cream cheese mixture completely covers and seals the crust. This will help keep the jello layer from seeping down.
1. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (can be refrigerated overnight at this point).
1. In a bowl, whisk together jello and boiling water until jello is completely dissolved. Add the strawberries. Refrigerate for 5 minutes and then pour on top of cream cheese layer. Refrigerate until firm.
