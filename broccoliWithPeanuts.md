4 Servings

## Ingredients
 - 1 bunch broccoli (about 1 1/2 pounds)
 - 3 tablespoons olive oil
 - Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
 - 1 freshly ground pepper
 - 2 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
 - 1/4 cup unsalted, roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
 - 1/2 teaspoon sugar
 - 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, plus more
 - 4 scallions, thinly sliced
 - Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon)

## Directions
 1. Prehead oven to 450F
 2. Peel Brocholi Stems, cut in half long way and then slice on a large bias 4mm thick. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet, toss with oil, and season with kosher salt.
Roast stems until browned around edges, 15-20 minutes. Add vinegar; toss to coat.
 3. Meanwhile, heat a dry cast iron skillet, over medium-high. Add florets. Season with kosher salt and cook, stirring often, until bright green and lightly charred in spots, about 5 minutes. 
  Reduce heat to low; add peanuts and sugar. Cook, stirring, until nuts are golden brown. Stir in 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast; season again.
 4. Serve broccoli stems and florets topped with scallions, sea salt, and more yeast.
