# Japanese Cucumber Salad #

 * 1/4 cup rice vinegar
 * 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
 * 4 regular cucumbers
 * 1 tablespoon coarse salt
 * 1 tablespoon sugar, or to taste
 * sesame seeds

Peel and seed cucumbers and diagonally cut into 1/8- to 1/4-inch-thick slices.
In a colander set over a bowl toss cucumbers with salt and drain 30 minutes.
Rinse cucumbers well and pat dry. Pour bonito mixture through a fine sieve
into a large bowl and toss liquid with cucumbers and 1 tablespoon sugar;
if not using bonito flakes, toss cucumbers with vinegar, soy sauce, and 1
tablespoon sugar, or to taste. With scissors cut nori lengthwise into
thin strips.
