# Cinnamon Spice Roasted Carrots
Makes 2 servings.

## Ingredients
* 1 bunch of fresh carrots with green tops
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* A pinch of sea salt (add more to taste)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon of agave nectar or honey


# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Trim the greens tops off your carrots so they don't suck the moisture out of the root (the part you eat).
3. Combine both dry ingredients and wet ingredients in separate bowls.
4. Place carrots on a baking sheet and drizzle oil-agave mixture on top. Toss to coat.
5. Sprinkle on the spice mix and coat evenly. (You can reserved any leftover for future use.)
6. Arrange carrots in a single layer so they cook evenly.
7. Cook for 20-30 minutes (depending on size) or until carrots are just tender and slightly carmelized, tossing once halfway through.
