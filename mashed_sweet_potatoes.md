# Mashed Sweet Potatoes

Based on a recipe from https://cookingupmemories.com/mashed-sweet-potatoes/

## Ingredients
- 6 lbs Sweet Potatoes
- 3 cup Half and Half
- 6 tbsp + 3 tbsp Unsalted Butter 
- 9 tbsp Brown Sugar 
- 3 tsp salt 
- 1.5 tsp Ground Cinnamon
- 1.5 cup Chopped Pecans 
- Fresh Thyme

## Steps
1. Wash and peel sweet potatoes.
2. Cut the potatoes into 1-inch pieces.
3. Add butter and the sweet potatoes to a dutch oven. Cook over medium heat until the potatoes begin to soften, 3-5 minutes, stirring often.
4. Add the half and half and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and continue a slow simmer.
5. Cook the potatoes until they become super tender. Cooking time is 15-25 minutes, depending on how big the potatoes were diced. Stir frequently to keep potatoes from sticking or burning on the bottom of the pan. The cream may curdle, but don’t worry; it will smooth out when you mash the potatoes.
6. Remove cooked sweet potatoes from the heat and add the brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Using a potato masher mash the potatoes until they become smooth.
7. To the sweet potato mixture, stir in all but a little bit of the pecans and the remaining butter. You can use melted butter, but it’s unnecessary if your potatoes are hot.
8. Top with remaining pecans.
