Based on https://www.thespruceeats.com/old-fashioned-giblet-gravy-with-hard-boiled-eggs-3057037

## Ingredients

 - Giblets and turkey neck
 - 4 cups water (cold)
 - 4 tablespoons butter
 - 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 - 2 cups chicken broth
 - 1/2 cup milk (or half-and-half)
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Directions
1. Place the giblets (except the liver) and turkey neck into a saucepan and cover with 4 cups cold water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the giblets for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. At this point add the liver to the saucepan and simmer for another 30 minutes.

1. Place a mesh strainer or colander over a bowl. Drain the giblets and set the liquids aside to use in the gravy, if needed. Let the giblets cool. Remove the meat from the neck for other recipes.  Chop with the liver and discard the rest of the giblets.

1. Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan and stir in the flour. Cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the roux just barely begins to turn golden.

1. add the giblet broth or chicken or turkey stock to make 2 cups. Slowly stir in the broth into the roux. Add the milk or half-and-half. Continue cooking and stirring until thickened.
1. Taste and season the gravy with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
