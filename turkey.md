# Turkey

Derived from Alton Browns

## Ingredients
- 1 Turkey (~20lbs)


### Aromatics
- 1 red apple, sliced
- 1/2 onion, sliced
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 cup water
- 4 sprigs rosemary
- 6 leaves sage
- Canola oil

## Directions

1. 4 days before roasting. Begin thawing the turkey in the refrigerator or in a cooler kept at 38 degrees F. 

1. Early on the day or the night before you'd like to eat: 
 - Wash turkey inside and out.  Remove giblets and neck
 - Dry the turkey with paper towels
 - Place turkey on the rack breast side up.
 - Cover with plastic wrap and put in fridge


1. 3 hours before preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. 
 - Combine the apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and 1 cup of water in a microwave safe dish and microwave on high for 5 minutes. Add steeped aromatics to the turkey's cavity along with the rosemary and sage. 
 - Tuck the wings underneath the bird 
 - coat the skin liberally with canola oil. 

1. Roast the turkey on lowest level of the oven at 400 degrees F for 20 minutes. Insert a probe thermometer into thickest part of the breast and reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Set the thermometer alarm (if available) to 161 degrees F. A 14 to 16 pound bird should require a total of 2 to 2 1/2 hours of roasting. Let the turkey rest, loosely covered with foil or a large mixing bowl for 15 minutes before carving.
