# Cheesy Tomato Bread

Derived from http://www.whatmegansmaking.com/2012/08/cheesy-tomato-bread.html

## Ingredients
1 loaf french bread, sliced lengthwise
3 Tbsp butter
1/2 - 1 Tbsp garlic powder (to taste)
3-4 fresh tomatoes, thinly sliced
1 tsp kosher salt (use 1/2 tsp if using salted butter)
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 tsp oregano
8 oz sliced or shredded mozzarella cheese

## Directions

Preheat oven to 500. Spread each slice of bread evenly with butter and sprinkle with garlic. Lay the tomato slices on top, then sprinkle with salt, olive oil and oregano. *Note: If using juicy garden tomatoes, you may want to let the slices sit on a paper towel for a minute before laying them on the bread.

Top with cheese and place on a foil lined baking sheet. Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese melts and the bread begins to toast. Turn the oven to broil and and leave them in the oven for 2-3 minutes longer, or until the cheese browns. Slice the bread into 4-inch sections and serve.
