Derived from https://eatforum.org/learn-and-discover/day-4-barley-otto-with-roasted-root-veggies/

## Ingredients

### Barleyotto

- 300 ml pearl barley, soaked for at least 3 hours
- 1 shallot
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 100 ml apple juice
- 500 ml vegetable stock
- 100 ml parmesan cheese, grated
- 100 ml fresh herbs, chopped (such as parsley, chives and basil)
- A few drops of lemon juice
- Salt and ground pepper
- 3 tbsp hazelnuts, chopped and roasted
- 3 tbsp pumpkin seeds, roasted

### Roasted root vegetables

- 3 beetroot
- 4 carrots
- 1 small celeriac
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp honey
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and ground pepper

## Directions

1. Wash, clean and cut all the root vegetables into evenly-sized wedges, pieces or sticks. Mix the vegetables with the crushed garlic, lemon juice, honey, olive oil, and season with salt and pepper and spread them out on a baking tray (or an oven-proof dish) covered with a greaseproof paper. Roast the vegetables for about 40 minutes at 200 degrees C until they are tender. Turn the vegetables a few times while they are roasting.
1. Finely chop the shallot and fry in olive oil until transparent. Add the pearl barley and stir well.
1. Add the apple juice and chicken stock. Leave to simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pearl barley is soft and most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in the cheese and herbs and season with a few drops of lemon juice, salt and freshly-ground pepper.
1. Dish out the pearl barley risotto on plates and top with roasted vegetables. Sprinkle with nuts and pumpkin seed kernels to flavor it up!
