# Warm Farro Salad

## Ingredients
* Â¾ Cup Pearled Faro
* 3 Ounces Arugula
* 1 Fennel Bulb With Fronds 
* 1 Navel Orange
* 1 Bunch Mint
* 2 Ounces Castelvetrano Olives
* 2 Ounces Crumbled Feta Cheese
* 2 Ounces Hazelnuts
* 2 Tablespoons Pomegranate Seeds
* 1 Teaspoon Herbes De Provence

## Instructions
1. Cook the farro & add the arugula:
```
Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the farro and cook, stirring occasionally, 14 to 16 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. Add the arugula and a drizzle of olive oil; stir to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
```
2. Prepare the ingredients:
```
While the farro cooks, pick off some of the fennel fronds (the green, thread-like tops of the plant); roughly chop. Separate the fennel bulb and stems; thinly slice the stems. Halve the bulb lengthwise; remove and discard the core. Thinly slice the bulb. Using a peeler, remove the rind of the orange, avoiding the white pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest. Cut the top and bottom off the orange; cut away and discard the remaining white pith. Cut out the orange segments (or supremes) from between the membranes; place in a bowl. Squeeze the juice from the membranes over the supremes; discard the membranes. Pick the mint off the stems; roughly chop. Using the side of your knife, smash the olives and discard the pits, then roughly chop. Roughly chop the hazelnuts.
