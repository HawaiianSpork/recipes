# Warm Farro Salad
Makes 2 servings. Fennel is in season from Fall until Spring.

## Ingredients
* Â¾ Cup Pearled Faro
* 3 Ounces Arugula
* 1 Fennel Bulb With Fronds 
* 1 Navel Orange
* 1 Bunch Mint
* 2 Ounces Castelvetrano Olives
* 2 Ounces Crumbled Feta Cheese
* 2 Ounces Hazelnuts
* 2 Tablespoons Pomegranate Seeds
* 1 Teaspoon Herbes De Provence

## Instructions
**1. Cook the farro & add the arugula:**
<p>Wash and dry the fresh produce. Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the farro and cook, stirring occasionally, 14 to 16 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot. Add the arugula and a drizzle of olive oil; stir to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.<p />
**2. Prepare the ingredients:**
<p>While the farro cooks, pick off some of the fennel fronds (the green, thread-like tops of the plant); roughly chop. Separate the fennel bulb and stems; thinly slice the stems. Halve the bulb lengthwise; remove and discard the core. Thinly slice the bulb. Using a peeler, remove the rind of the orange, avoiding the white pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest. Cut the top and bottom off the orange; cut away and discard the remaining white pith. Cut out the orange segments (or supremes) from between the membranes; place in a bowl. Squeeze the juice from the membranes over the supremes; discard the membranes. Pick the mint off the stems; roughly chop. Using the side of your knife, smash the olives and discard the pits, then roughly chop. Roughly chop the hazelnuts.<p />
**3. Toast the hazelnuts:**
<p>Heat a medium pan on medium-high until hot. Add the hazelnuts and toast, stirring constantly, 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Wipe out the pan.<p />
**4. Caramelize the fennel:**
<p>In the same pan used to toast the hazelnuts, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the fennel bulb and stems. Cook, stirring occasionally, 7 to 9 minutes, or until browned and caramelized. Remove from heat.<p />
**5. Make the sauce:**
<p>Off the heat, to the pan of caramelized fennel, add the orange supremes (and the juice from the bowl), orange zest, Herbes de Provence, olives, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of water; stir to thoroughly combine and season with salt and pepper to taste.<p />
**6. Finish & plate your dish:**
<p>To the pot of dressed farro and arugula, add the toasted hazelnuts, mint and caramelized fennel-orange sauce. Toss to thoroughly combine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide the farro salad between 2 plates. Garnish with the pomegranate seeds, feta cheese and fennel fronds. Enjoy!<p />
