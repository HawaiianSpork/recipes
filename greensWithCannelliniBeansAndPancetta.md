# Greens with Cannellini Beans and Pancetta
Makes 2 servings.

## Ingredients
* 2 slices pancetta or bacon, chopped in 1/2 inch pieces
* 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 small red onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 bunch kale, roughly chopped
* 1 bunch beet greens, roughly chopped
* salt to taste
* 1 (15 ounce) can cannellini beans, drained

## Directions
1. In a large frying pan, cook the chopped pancetta on medium heat until crispy. Set pancetta aside.
2. Cook onion in pancetta drippings for about 2 minutes.
3. Add the crushed garlic cloves, and cook a minute more until slightly charred.
4. Stir in chopped greens, and season with salt to taste (be conservative at this point - you can always add more!). Partially cover the pan, and cook until the greens begin to wilt.
5. Stir in crispy pancetta and cannellini beans. Cook partially covered for 5 more minutes, until the flavors have combined and the greens are tender.
